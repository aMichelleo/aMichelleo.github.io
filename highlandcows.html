	<h2> About Highland Cows </h1>
		<p> As babies, highland cows are argueably some of the cutest baby animals that you will come across. Many say they get less cute once they have become fully grown, but they have a special charisma and charm even as I adults, I think. 'Why do people think they make such cute animals?'' you might ask. Here are some of their most prevalent and lovable qualities.</p>
		<ul>
<li>They are extremely fluffy. They have fur similar to a teddy bear that sticks out in an endearing way.</li>
<li>They have a nice orange color that is very refreshing to see, as most cows are black, white, or brown. </li>
<li>They have big, cute eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, it is not without reason that they are so adored among the population. Once they get older they grow horns, they stop looking cute. </p>
